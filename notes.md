## Notes as I go along

For previous reference, and as a scratchpad to keep thoughts on, I'm keeping
some notes here.

I've only got a little experience with Tornado; but this looks like a good
opportunity to learn Flask, which has been recommended to me, and Tornado seems
to have a bad reputation anyway, so I might as well avoid it!

I'm going with an API key authentication system, because it's easiest to implement...but a little googling shows that Flask actually does have some nice authentication tools built in. If I get time, I should try using those.
